## Projects
### Bangalore House Price Prediction 
[Project link](https://house-prediction-p7qa.onrender.com)

Developed a machine learning module that could predict house prices of Bangalore using **Python**. This data-driven approach led to better prediction of house prices that takes on features like sq ft area, location, number of bedrooms and bathrooms. Further for a easy convience and a user interface developed a Python flask that can carry out frontend user query to the backend and server and deployed the an app.html at render.</br>

### Detecting Iris Flower Using Machine Learning 
[Project Link](https://github.com/Sudecon5/Iris)

Used **Jupyter Notebook** to train model to identify the type of iris flowers based on sepal width, sepal length, petal width and petal length. The dataset contained features which could be further classified whether they were setosa, versicolor or virginica. The machine learning model include Logistic Regression which attained 100 percent accuracy in prediction. </br>
