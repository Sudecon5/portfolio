## Projects
### Bangalore House Price Prediction 
[Project link](https://house-prediction-p7qa.onrender.com)

Developed a machine learning module that could predict house prices of Bangalore using **Python**. This data-driven approach led to better prediction of house prices that takes on features like sq ft area, location, number of bedrooms and bathrooms. Further for a easy convience and a user interface developed a Python flask that can carry out frontend user query to the backend and server and deployed the an app.html at render.</br>

### Detecting Iris Flower Using Machine Learning 
[Project Link](https://github.com/Sudecon5/Iris)

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
